# Earthquake Prediction Model

## Introduction
This Python-based Earthquake Prediction Model is designed to help you predict earthquakes based on historical seismic data. It uses machine learning techniques to make predictions. This README provides instructions on how to run the code, lists the necessary dependencies, includes the dataset source, and provides a brief description of the project.

## Dataset Source

The seismic data used in this project was obtained from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Earthquake Hazards Program. You can access the data at the following URL: [USGS Earthquake Data](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.6 or higher installed.
- The following Python libraries:
    - NumPy
    - Pandas
    - Scikit-learn
    - Matplotlib
    - Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the provided Jupyter notebooks).

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone 
https://github.com/AbithaJ/Project-phase5.git 
2. Install the required Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

### 1. Data Preparation

Before you can run the model, you need to prepare your earthquake data. Follow these steps:

- Acquire historical seismic data from the USGS Earthquake Data website.
- Clean and preprocess the data to have the required format. You can use the provided data preprocessing scripts in the `data_preparation` directory.

### 2. Model Training

1. Open a Jupyter Notebook or your Python IDE.

2. Navigate to the `model_training` directory.

3. Open the `train_earthquake_model.ipynb` notebook.

4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to train the earthquake prediction model using your prepared data.

### 3. Prediction

1. After training the model, you can use it to make earthquake predictions. Open a Jupyter Notebook or your Python IDE.

2. Navigate to the `prediction` directory.

3. Open the `earthquake_prediction.ipynb` notebook.

4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to make earthquake predictions based on your model.

## Configuration

You can adjust various model parameters and configurations in the code, depending on your specific dataset and requirements. Be sure to read the documentation and comments in the code for more information.
